# ExampleASAN

This is a project that shows how to use ASan on a production Android device using wrap.sh.

The steps to getting this to work:
1.) ensure Android 8.1 is minimum OS being targeted.
2.) Ensure NDK is at least version 17
3.) use the same build.gradle as demo'd here.

NB.  This project does not need to use asan_device_setup.  Full explanation and details can be found at my medium post here: https://medium.com/@gpx1000/oreo-ndk-secrets-7d075a9b084
